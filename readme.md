Next type 127.0.0.1:8000 in the url section to access the project.</p>

<B>HOW TO CARRY OUT CRUD OPERATIONS FOR THIS PROJECT</B>

1) After hitting the url - 127.0.0.1:8000, you will find a form, a search bar, a table filled with records and buttons to export this data in a desired format.
2) Through this form you can add new book record into the database. Now the newly created data will be shown in the table which is below the form.
3) Table in this page can be used to edit and delete records by clicking on the action buttons.
4) Also, you can sort the title and author by clicking on the table headers of this table.
5) Through search bar you can search book records either by entering a book title or author name.
6) With 'csv export' and 'excel export' button you can extract the data in 3 ways. 
    a) details of all the books
    b) only book title 
    c) only book author


For CRUD operations and validations, test cases are also written that gives good test coverage.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
